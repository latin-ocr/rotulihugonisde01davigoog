T of Hugh de Welles The work of preparing thern for
the press has been performed by the General-Editor, who has
received, and desires to acknowledge, much valuable assistance.
The Rev. H. E. Salter, Mn, has kindly collated many of the
transcripts with their original; Prehendary Hingeston·Randolph
has read most of the pages in type, and, while detecting some
errors, offered very useful suggestions which, however, could
only be followed as far as the plan of the work allowed. The
Rev. W. O. Massingberd, Mn, examined the identifications of
all the Lincolnshire names and supplied many modern equiva-
lents to the old forms—an undertaking only possible to one
thoroughly at horne in Lincolnshire topography. To each
of these authorities thanks are offered for contributing to

Volume 111 much of the accuracy and usefulness which it

is hoped it will be found to possess
